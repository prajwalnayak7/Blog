Breathtaking! A stare at the water falling from 100s of feet above the ground, gives an illusion of heaven. The milk-ish water molecules racing to hit the ground is a mesmerizing view. Sitting on the rocks and just staring at them for hours brings tranquility. It makes one realize what true beauty is, how insignificant one is at the face of a larger creation.
By observing the crowd, It seemed like everybody is into modeling.</description>

A year ago I, while returning to my home, from the Venugopal temple, lost my way and ended up in the crowded Manipal Campus. At that moment I saw myself to be a student there in the distant hypothetical future. Destiny aligned with my interests, received admission there, in my favorite branch.</description>
