 ncalls is the total number of calls that the function makes. tottime is the total time spent in the function alone. cumtime is the total time spent in the function plus all the functions that it in-turn calls.</description>

Breathtaking! A stare at the water falling from 100s of feet above the ground, gives an illusion of heaven. The milk-ish water molecules racing to hit the ground is a mesmerizing view.
