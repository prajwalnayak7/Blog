  <div class="post-content"><p>The long journey via a single-axle bus came to an end at Andheri, but I never anticipated the difficulty of reaching a suburb destination in Mumbai. Better planning would have prevented my struggle with finding an affordable and effective means of reaching Powai. Google Maps always comes to the rescue, though the ground reality may not always be what it looks like. The Mumbai metro did its bit in pacifying my sweat shed shirts through its air conditioning. Somehow I managed to reach the campus. Yet another challenging expedition was awaiting me. None of the guards knew the building or fossee.</p>
<p>An opportunity to contribute to the open source software at the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. Having reached there a day earlier than the mentioned date, only to be found out later that many interns had already spent a day in the alternative accommodation provided by the FOSSEE team. Anyways happy to be one among the 60 out of ~4000 applicants for the opportunity. I was tasked with porting the optimization toolbox to windows and adding additional functionality along the way. Nothing of what I knew how; nonetheless we had to figure it out (and we did).</p>
<p>A bustling morning threw me out of my bed long before the sunrise. The adventurer in me was charged towards an expedition tto the nearby foothills. Half a day swept pass me in relocating to the official hostels and completing various formalities. Heavy, hungry and tired, by evening everything seemed to be settled. The best part, food :) cheap, delicious, unlimited in the mess. Challenging tasks with deadlines, little assistance from the mentors. Exciting journey, hell yeah.</p>
<p>Day N, at 10 in the morning, met my professor/ mentor for scilab project. Excited to know his qualifications and expertise in operations research. The roadmap for the entire internship was being discussed. Disappointing search for a suitable mess or at least a canteen nearby. First interaction with the head of fossee. A frustrating trail and error kinda strategy was the only way to complete the assigned tasks. I didn&rsquo;t understand a thing about the topics given to me. Neither did I have any knowledge nor any interest. Still it was the most satisfying experience and the best choice I had to spend my summer vacations. Finally, I learnt to operate a washing machine and thanked the past slew of engineers for saving a mammoth of human labour. Befriending the reality and complete acceptance of it will make a way for the mind to be in the present.</p>
<p>Day N+?, an energetic morning landing in the GymKhana, unplanned yet a good one. Reaching the office before time, full on to finish the task. Somehow, through consistency, was able to do so at the end of the day. Surprisingly my teammate turned out to be smarter than I. A great feeling of achievement, though loads of mixed emotions flooding my mind. Many questions, lack of data, lack of connections. A dream of becoming an entrepreneur, a value creator, a leader, a business manager, an executive. The undying spirit of doing something, I don&rsquo;t know what, how. It&rsquo;s just about connecting the dots. Everything is there, just the right connection will create the flow. Situations prove again and again that I don&rsquo;t have enough people skills. But nothing is going to stop me getting some more. Interpersonal management is going to be a major focus in my coming days.</p>
<p>The world yoga day with Yogathon 108 surya namaskars, ah. Enjoyed the ride indulged in energetic and enthusiastic asan. Never thought possible until the wave of almost every other participant doing it with confidence took along with me until the completion. An unfathomable experience and the birth of a deep urge to continue or start doing 108 asanas.</p>
<p>Day N+?+?, pale, hungry young man with a spirit of knowing and getting stronger. The scope of progress in the project seemed to be bleak. A little happiness was achieved by the massive increment to my geofencing application. A plan is very important, though not a perfect one, at least have one. Sweating profusely through my winter formal shirts, carrying a giant on my shoulders, staring at the farthest object aspiring to train my sight to get back their strength. A free trip to marine drive, culture, music, dance, fun. It&rsquo;s these kind of events that remind me how beautiful life is. In the midst of daily chores and problems the I loose the awareness of value of life. Be aligned with the truth, the rest will take care. Deception is the path towards suffering. A lot of data, huh. It&rsquo;s time for human brains to evolve in its capacity to handle ‚Äòbig data‚Äô.</p>
<p>Project completion, released new version !</p>

<p>A trek to the nearby Kanheri Caves</p>
<p>Lots of memories.</p>
<p>Bye Bye MumBai.</p>
