Life at college is the time when the teenage years end and we all dive deep into the ocean of new
beginnings and possibilities. The diamond jubilee year for Manipal Institute of Technology, and my
second year of engineering started after a long summer vacations of about two and a half months, in the
rainy month of august. The year that welcomed engineering undergrads to their respective branches. It
was that time when a student gets the feeling of being a ‘senior’. I was very happy that no longer I have
to study the basic electronics or the basic mechanical engineering, which was compelled on all the
students during their first year of engineering. The energy and confidence instilled in me by the
KSHAMATA camps remained with me and were waiting to do something significant in the coming days. I
was excited to listen to my department professors and start learning the core subjects of computer
science. It was a declining curve as usual, it soon became like ‘I had to listen to my professors, in order
to maintain a 75% attendance’.


I was very enthusiastic to become a part of one of the most diverse and vibrant student community in
the entire of south India. But the classes at eight were a nightmare. It was very hard to convince myself
to get out the bed, and terminate my peaceful sleep combined with the beautiful sound of the rain
droplets clashing the windows of my room due to gravity. One could easily see the effect of the
problem, by observing a few hostelites brushing their teeth’s at the academic block washrooms,
sometimes even taking a shower there. These silly and humorous things makes student life beautiful.
Initial interaction with north Indian students was a bit hard. But soon I gave up the hesitation and made
a few new friends. The smartphones gave people a way to hide behind their egos and appear to be
social or busy doing something important. I was very happy to interact with some of the smartest brains
in my country. But the lecturers still appeared to be as if they were from a different planet, a typical
ideology developed in me in the past thirteen years of formal education. But consistent efforts were
made to reduce the gap. The classes were almost dead in terms of interaction between the professors
and the students. But it would become lively again when it was the break time. Many classes stretched
into night time hours. A canteen in the same floor as that my classroom assured that I fed my stomach
well. The only thing that motivated me to attend the classes is the free Wi-Fi and AC.
The awareness of the importance and opportunities in profile building was very significant in the way I
invested my time. A lot of my free time was spent in learning from excellent online resources, most of
which is provided free of cost. I don’t like reading books but I tried doing so. I completed reading a few
of them like ‘think and grow rich’ by Napoleon Bonaparte and ‘the power of now’ by Eckhart Tolle. A few
prominent companies like Philips and Microsoft had conducted hack-a-thons. Participating in such
events gave me exposure to the emerging fields in technology like data science and cloud computing,
and of course some credits. A lot of eminent personalities were invited to give talks. No matter who
conducted or gave the talks, I was always there to listen. That thought me a few things about the real
world. Workshops conducted by exam training institutes like Byjus and Collegepond were immensely
informative. It motivated me to do my higher studies abroad. Clubs were just not my cup of tea, I didn’t
bother to join any. I met with a few failures while trying to join the organizer team for the technical fest.
It didn’t stop my spirit of trying to do something or unearthing any opportunity in the campus. It felt
good to be in the crowd of a national level fest, which witnessed a large number of students from
various parts of the country. The technical fest showcased a blended variety of events. I decided to
participate in maximum possible number of events, but didn’t manage to win any. I realized the heated
competition that one has to face in this over populated country. It was disappointing, yet informative as
it was the reality. Luckily as my university offered vast stream of options for profile building and gaining
practical work exposure. I became aware of IAESTE and AIESEC, the two international, student run
organizations operating in my college. Both of them were offering volunteering and internship
opportunities abroad.


The last few months of the semester were spent without even realizing how it was done so. Time flied
with each chapter being completed. My mother used to ask me to do a lot of trivial things. I had to
express my inevitably busy schedule by saying ‘no’. A few things said by the seniors actually came to be
very true. I remembered one quote by a great warrior ‘The more you sweat in the training ground, the
less you bleed in the battle field ’. It proved to be fruitful at a later stage. During the end semester
examinations, life was going at full throttle, and one fine day suddenly it felt like life had applied a
handbrake. The semester break of one month, I being in an autonomous college, consider myself as very
lucky as there are enough number of days in the vacations. Still the holidays flew at the pace of a
cheetah compared to the classes that have the pace of a donkey. The best few days of the vacations
were as usual spent at the KSHAMATA camp. I realized the teachings at the camp to be more useful than
the learnings of my entire semester. That literally gives a new dimension to ones thought process. I was
very bad at people skills like networking or public speaking. It’s a good fact that everyone at the camp
has the motive to learn and hence it’s perfectly ok to make mistakes. Whereas in the real world on
would pay a heavy price for the mistakes that one may or may not have done. I had a very blurry vision
of my plans for the upcoming years. As usual the decision of taking up a job versus higher studies. The
informative talks given at the camps gave me confidence to opt for higher studies. Considering the
percentage of student population that get the level of support and aid that WKC is offering, I feel very
privileged to be a VKSSF scholar. When I told some of my friends about the camps, they were surprised
and were even willing to pay or learn Konkani language in order to receive the opportunity that I had
almost taken for granted.


The first month of 2017, January was spent in gearing up for a new semester, applying for passports and
other documents. I invested my weekends running a few kilometers. It helped me complete a 5 KM
marathon conducted by Manipal University. Completing online courses was the need of the hour, to
prepare my profile to be accepted for an internship. I managed to complete three online courses and
become certified in web technologies. Working on mini projects helped me get some experience in
practical technologies. I had planned to do many more things but due to the academic constraints it was
hard to find time compromising the grades, which too is important at the end. I struggled hard to find an
internship for the summer, but companies were asking for previous experience, which doesn't make
sense for a fresher who just completed second year of engineering. Soon I came across an association
called as IAESTE (International Association for Exchange of Students for Cultural and Technical
experience) in my university, offering paid internships abroad. My cousin had done one such internship
and he recommended me to try it. There were offers from Germany, Poland, Lebanon, Thailand, etc. But
the offer from Tanzania had an excellent project opportunity. The network of people I have abroad, all
of them supported me in my decision. I am hopeful that it will benefit me in admissions for my higher
studies. The learning from the camps benefitted me immensely in passing the interviews. Especially in
writing cover letters and applications, the forcefully written mails during the camps, did aid me in
understanding the style and format of official mail writing. In order to get a stronger CV, I had started
searching for opportunities over the web in the sites like Intershala and LinkedIn. Some of my friends
had received internships with the help of their parents, family or friends and their contacts. Coming
from a humble background that’s something that I was not lucky enough to have. It convinced me about
the importance and power of networking.


The best part of any engineering college is the cultural fests. I was waiting for it from a long time, to
release the pressure. I enjoyed being a part of the audience like most of my fellow mates. The first few
days of the fest witnessed a vibrant crowd with people from different walks of life. Some scary
physiological illusions, excellent dance performances, and events like fashion shows filled the entire
week with beautiful memories and experiences. I believe it to be the learnings that cannot be
substituted with any form of book based studies. I became aware of my weakness and strengths. For
example till I was in my first year of engineering, I thought that I was good at a lot of things like dancing.
But soon a few incidents dispelled the false assumptions. An event conducted at the hotel management
college helped to identify a good chef in me. I started learning the basics of cooking from my mother. I
am also aware that it would be beneficial at a later stage when I’ll have to live at the hostels and cook
my own food. I would really love it if the entire engineering curriculum evolved into a practical training
program.


The scarcity of time and energy has concerned humanity over the years. It has become much more
apparent in these years. Fortunately or unfortunately I too became a person with a messy timetable. I
am very lucky to be enrolled into a course that has one of the most flexible and updated curriculum in
India. The surprise assignments made me to be on track every single day and be prepared to expect the
unexpected. It was a well thought system of continuous evaluation and learning, but it made our lives
miserable. But the ‘smart’ phones and the mercy of our fellow nine pointers could actually save people’s
internals. I had to motivate myself to study mathematics by telling myself ‘one last time ‘. My interest
for math took a round turn after coming to engineering. As it was very abstract and pretty hard to make
sense out of anything in it. It was the last semester that had included this subject and for three credits.
The lab examinations were not something of a pleasant experience. But, useful to learn the application
of theory and be more competitive in terms of utilizing the time and other resources effectively. I scored
pretty well in that semester, blessed by the kindness of my math professor. The good thing was that my
academic performance had an increasing curve. I am hopeful that it will be an attractive trait in my
profile.


An internship in Africa! As strange as it sounds, as unique was it. A lovely project with a purpose of
massive social inclusion made me opt for the less known country, Tanzania. Peaceful population and
helpful locals made the stay very convenient. The university that I worked for had special department
called as Assistive Technology Unit (ASTU) that provides ICT training for the people with disabilities. Due
to the poor health and economic conditions of African people living in remote areas, they cannot afford
to treat themselves and hence lose their sight or become hard of hearing. ASTU had professors who
themselves were with some disabilities. They conduct practical technology training classes for a few
months and most of the students get CISCO certified. The placement statistics were also pretty good. I
worked under the head of the unit and built a 100% accessible website for the blind students which had
built-in voice navigation technology. I got some exposure and understanding of the problems that such
people face and the way they perceive and interact with the rest of the world. At a later stage, along
with a sign language expert we developed ICT signs and built a web application especially for the
disabled people. It was the first of its kind, and the first attempt in the world to make such resources
open and freely available over the internet. So that a deaf person, with or without any formal education,
from any corner of the world can learn on his/her own. I made a few presentations explaining them
about some of the software applications and my work at the university. A few students came to my
office and tried to express their gratitude. It was a very beautiful feeling.


Apart from the project work, I met some wonderful people and made strong local connections. My local
friends there helped me in almost every aspect, like travel, accommodation, food, language, etc. It gave
me an opportunity to save a lot of cost. Finding routes in Bangalore itself is very hard and it’s obvious
that it would be harder in any foreign country. But Google maps was the savior for finding routes and
landmarks. The people there spoke a strange language Kiswahili, picking a few words here and there
was not that hard as to some extent it resembled the Mangalorean local language Tulu. I learnt to plan
things, connect with people and also learn a lot about the world and the way it works. Cultural exposure
and interaction with other international trainees was one of the best part of the internship. I got an
opportunity to visit the Masai tribes in the remote areas of Tanzania. By interacting with random people
I came to know the kind of image that my country India has in the minds of foreign nationals. I spent one
of the weekend volunteering for an NGO called as Project Inspire, which had organized STEM (science,
technology, engineering and medicine) workshop and motivational talks for the children. It was a unique
experience where I could see a few kids much smarter than me. I ended up receiving a nice T shirt and
some free food. Using the network of my local friends I, along with other interns got an opportunity to
attend the east Africa’s largest startup competition. The wired language, dressing style, food, and many
more added a spicy flavor to the experience. IAESTE played a major role is helping me out with the
major problems that an individual faces in a foreign land. It was overall a great time spent, networking,
chatting and chilling out at the nearby islands and beaches. The university professors were very kind,
that they even sponsored our party’s. From the foothills of Mt. Kilimanjaro to the top of 22 story
building, I have seen it all. Never could I imagine that such an opportunity would knock my door so early.
Now I am left with beautiful memories, strong multinational friendships, powerful profile, and a strong
desire to have such a life changing experience again.


In summary, my time in college has enriched my life in many ways. It has provided me with the
necessary tools to enrich my skills more, taught me valuable lessons about this diverse world, its people
and concepts in general and will eventually enable me be a better person when I finally graduate and
get my degree. This golden period prepared me for all the challenges that life has to throw at me and
create a strong foundation of knowledge. It has also stressed to me the importance of thinking critically
and asking questions in many situations. The one best skill I have learnt by living in dorms is the
adaptability to any situation or any kind of person. The most significant change in my life was the
workload. It was heavier and more intense that ever experienced before. The world is getting
fragmented and I started contributing to it by giving less time to my family. I have skipped my lunch a lot
of times, but never my sleep. The fun part was to observe people of unique and sometimes weird
personalities. College life is also pleasurable for providing a large company of like-minded young men of
the same age and similar interest. I see myself as a less shy person now, and a bit more confident while
talking to women. An infinite willingness to find oneself, visible in my frequent visits to the nearby
Malpe beach or the sunset at the End point and the dry lakes of Manipal. The major challenges of
college work were the large volume of reading, the short deadlines, and the writing, writing, writing. I
was away from comforts and friendships many a times that my home provided me in the previous years.
All these aspects have also made me more well-rounded as a person. These experiences are truly
irreplaceable and I would not trade them for anything. Now having spent two long years as a college
student I understand that with college, comes a whole lot of responsibility and independence. Not only
do I get the freedom to take classes of my choice and ones that also peak my interest and push me
closer to my desired career. If I could go back in time and speak to my much younger self when I was
first asked the question, “What has been your best experience?” the baby-faced version of me would
certainly have been surprised by what my answer is now.
