In 2015, a tyro entered the [WORLD KONKANI CENTER](https://vishwakonkani.org/) with no idea whatsoever. Analogous
to a stone, without an identity or pride towards where it came from. My understanding
and perspective were limited to a few people and a small geographic area. I was a nice
and nerdy person. But, I had to buck up, I had to work in the right direction to let my
inner talents sprout. It is an undeniable fact that WKC became a catalyst in the
transformation and rejuvenation of my naive personality. The kind of social engineering
that I had undergone made me into a person that I am today. It has been a long journey
since then, facing the vicissitudes of life, morphed into a skilled professional well
prepared to enter the rigid job market.

The first day of the first camp. Fresh morning, pale and intimidated faces. I, virtually
glued with a few of my friends began an exciting journey. First encounter with Guru Sir,
a preliminary session. I was caught in my attempt to help my friend during the fun
games. I embarrassed myself. The protective shell began to break which paved a way
for the fruit/nut to come out. I was clueless back then. But now, I feel a sense of deep
gratitude towards Guru Sir for doing what he did. He saw in me the potential that I
couldn’t recognize. And that was the beginning of the end of my comfort zone. The
thought of giving a speech was a nightmare. Given the fact that it had to be delivered in
a short period of time made it more challenging. It prepared me to face the worst case
scenario and to dare to accept the challenges in my future endeavors. I couldn’t go to
sleep easily on most of the nights spent at the camps. Notorious seniors did their best to
create long-lasting sweet memories at WKC. At the end of the first camp, I was full on
with high spirits and mammoth energy to face a new semester at my college. But, it
didn't stay for long, soon I got entangled with daily chores and academic ‘rituals’.
Empirical lessons are immortal. My weakness and my strengths became more lucid and
I had devised strategies to overcome the shortcomings that I had. Interaction people
from other colleges and streams proved to be quite fruitful. It gave me an insight as to
what I could probably do in my free time or vacations. I never enjoyed grammar, though
I could apply most of its rules in my writing or speaking activities. More light was thrown
upon the importance of language skills and the different ways to be more effective as a
person in the initial camps. Each of the group activities and the real-life scenarios was
elaborated and pointers were given as an effective takeaway. An elaboration on the
higher studies topic was something that I was actually looking for. I am very thankful to
the speakers for sharing their experiences. At that point in time, it instilled a lot of
confidence in me when I saw products of VKSSF doing well in the corporations and
global universities. I can clearly remember the speech Mr. Dinesh Pai gave in one of the
camps. I dreamt of seeing myself speaking so well in front in a large audience that day.
I’m happy to have inculcated the necessary courage and will to do so one day.
A few of the topics covered have made a deep impression in my memory. One such is
Stephen Covey's theory that stated that our circle of influence is always smaller than our
circle of concerns. I did realize at that point that I was actually wasting a lot my energy
and time in just worrying and most of the time coming up with no solution. The
information, like the various ways to be assertive and not to be either submissive or
aggressive, had direct implications for the practical situations that I face. Basic skills that
a team player should have like coordination, strategy planning and leadership are the
ones that I, to some extent could understand and think of better ways to contribute as
an individual to the team. I didn't feel sleepy as the content was great and the sessions
were very interactive. My lethargy was shunned away and the productivity level
increased significantly. It was definitely worth all the resources spent on conducting the
camps. A session where everyone was told to network and socialize with other scholars
was conducted in one of the camps. I realized the phenomenal power of networking. In
just a few minutes if I could connect and build small friendships with at a considerable
number of people, then It struck me that the time that I usually waste during the thirty
minutes break during my college hours could actually be utilized for increasing my reach
of people. I had made a point to make at least one new contact a week since then, not
just LinkedIn connections but the real human connections, with the ones who are in
some ways better than me. Such activities conducted in the camps convinced me that
things are not as hard as it looks and its possible for even a mediocre person like me to
an influential person. The surprising tasks at times made me eat my dinner a bit faster
in order to rush to the computer labs and prepare for the presentations. I realized that
the mountain of fear that was in me especially during the first few camps suddenly
appeared to have collapsed into a plateau. I was not sure if actually, the camps were
getting a bit easier or if I was getting tougher. The comfortable stay and the delicious
food made the overall experience very pleasant.

A normal phone battery would last for about two days, but the power-packed camps
could metaphorically recharge us with confidence lasting up to six months. When I look
back at myself, I see phenomenal changes in me as a person. Over a span of four
years and six camps, my confidence, communication and language skills, experiential
knowledge has increased exponentially. These positive changes were very evident
during and after the camps. There is still a huge room for improvement, which I believe
through my persistent efforts and the motivation instilled by alumni and stakeholders of
WKC, will bestow on me in the near future. Essential skills for anyone seeking to enter
the rigid job market were taught. A lot of corrections, tips, and tricks were shared to us
by the mentors. Group discussions with individual constructive feedbacks gave me an
insight into my weaker aspects. The mentors were very supportive and cleared my
fundamental mistakes and doubts. I had always considered the HR interviews as my
rejection round. It was due to my failures in similar predated interviews for managerial
responsibilities at my college. I didn’t find the interviews as scary as my friends and
fellow mates used to exaggerate. I had a clear and calm mind throughout the interview
process. Without any delays, I could answer most of the questions. In less than a
minute my mentor figured out what exactly was I doing wrong, that led to my rejections
in the past. I am very thankful to her for pointing it out directly, yet in a very smart way. I
learned a very important lesson that I should not show my smartness in a way that
might offend the interviewee or that might make him/her feel insecure. Answering some
of the tricky questions and also listening to creative replies from other scholars, I
understood a lot about the process. It was a little disappointing to witness the passage
of time at a very rapid phase. The team presentation and barbeque party were very
enjoyable, filled with creativity and emotions. It was a proud fact for me to know that
some of our alumni’s are studying in the world's top-ranked universities like Cornell and
Waterloo. It further strengthened my aspirations to pursue higher studies abroad. The
mock placements were an exciting and thrilling experience. I was very confident in what
I had written in my resume. The seniors gave me some pointers and tips for
improvement using their knowledge and experience. I expected them to be a little
tougher in the interviews. In spite of explaining every bit of my projects, I failed to
convey my message clearly to the interviewees. This made me realize that I have to
adapt myself to the level of the interviewees in terms of the simplicity of my words and
explanations. It is the job seekers responsibility to make the interview experience for the
recruiters, a pleasant one. It could be done with simple things like smiling, handshakes
and showing them gratitude and respect through careful choice of words. These were
some of the highlights of the learning that I had received in the placements focused
camp. Overall the camp was a perfect blend of learning and having fun, along with
loads of memories and experiences. Once a person, who was considered to be a
terrible communicator is now reviewed as a person with good communications and a
very confident attitude. It shows the effectiveness of the camps and the success of the
people behind it. KSHAMATA played a key role in unlocking the potentials that I had in a
deformed shape. As a sweet note at the end, I managed to get a ‘yes’ from both HR and
technical interviewees that day.

The moment I entered the WKC campus for the last camp, I could recall the frightened
novice that I was in the first camp. Having seen and experienced the place, people and
the challenging activities, I felt quite intrepid. The positive difference I could observe in
myself was quite evident. I was able to socialize better, connect to people with less
friction, though there has not been a significant increase in the number of my facebook
friends. In my limited perception of the social norms, there lived a fear of my invitation
being rejected. But I believe It's being evaporated slowly. Some of the key takeaways
from the mentors were things like locus of control, not to be hastily judgemental, etc. It
was quite enlightening to listen to their views about the 'real' world. I could relate a few
things that were told. The rest of the things thought was amalgamated with the
embryonic understanding that I had. The group presentation involved a brainstorming
activity within my team. I found out myself to be a knowledgeable person with ideas and
facts popping out as contents for the presentation of my team. With knowledge comes a
bit of arrogance when things don't go my way. I learned to deal with it, to carry every
individual of the team with the proceedings and be a better team player. The
appreciation by mentors made me realize that I was not as bad as I thought. But neither
was I as good as I could be. It implied the amount and kind of work I had to do in the
upcoming days particularly and then in the corporate world. The speeches given by
eminent personalities were quite refreshing. The key takeaways were the importance of
people skills, fixing and focusing on a single goal and never deviating from the
mammoth ambitions set by our individual instincts. I had the seed of the stock market
and business sowed in my mind from the moment I realized that I didn't want to be an
engineer for the rest of my life. It gave the necessary impetus to reinstall my passion for
reading books related to finance, economics and business. The best thing about the
structure of the camp is the synchronization of theoretical sessions with its practical
application. The importance of being empathetic, collaboration and communication in a
team and superiority of the team's goal or individual aspirations and prejudices are
some of the lessons that stayed with me. Having been through a ton of training sessions
I found the last few of them to be a little more than a cakewalk. It's a fresh memory of
my mind the day I gave the last presentation as a team at the camp. My team was
expecting to be the first one to go to the stage but ended up being the last one. I keenly
observed myself when I was ascending the stage. There was an insignificant amount of
fear left, a mere picayune compared to the first time I did the same. I could deliver the
contents pretty clearly which I'm ebullient about. But, I realized that I probably didn't
come out as a likable person in front of the audience. It's the same loophole I was trying
to fix from the past few years but without much of an improvement. I hope to learn and
understand the intricacies of human psychology. There was no lack of courage or
confidence. It makes me proud as it indicates the success of the camps. I'm now
surprisingly able to look at people's faces and speak without getting distracted. It's been
a long way from where I started, but it was a mere trailer. There are huge gaps that I
need to fill and to work on in order to achieve my ambitions. I was astonished the
moment I had the first glance at glowing candles. It's the first time that I had been to a
candlelight dinner, I was ingenious to even the BBQ party conducted in the previous
camp. The height of creativity that WKC team brings into the camp activities is
phenomenal. Great food and funny awards, it was a very enjoyable time. It proved to be
an enduring memory.

Last summer, I was offered a fellowship to contribute to open source software at IIT
Bombay. Though I was not very technically inclined, my presentation skills were lauded
by my colleagues and mentors. After rigorous tasks of writing essays with hundreds of
words in a short span of time during the camps, I can now write with little or no friction.
Recently during the campus placements, I was told to give an impromptu speech for a
minute. I didn’t expect to clear that interview round. But, to my surprise I did. I had no
idea about the extent to which the series of camps impacted me. A few moments before
my interview, I recalled my experiences at the camps, which instilled valor in me. I
managed to ace the situation and finally land an ambitious core job within the first few
days of the campus placement season. It was a very blissful surprise. Somewhere down
the line, the investments made by the people around me and my community had paid
off. Every year at PRERANA event, self-made achievers who carved out a niche for
themselves, motivated the scholars. The level of positivity and energy that it brings is
phenomenal. The life lessons and the perspective that they had shared in some ways
has shaped me as a human being. With every passing camp, I could perceive the subtle
differences in my way of handling difficult situations. I evolved over time, every camp
was different and innovative. At the end of every camp, I used to lament a little because
of the fact that the three days were over. It was the only place where I could make
mistakes and yet not get ridiculed, but take it as an opportunity to learn from it. There is
some sense of regret that I could have done it far better than what I did. But the end
results were way ahead of the expectations that I had the day I received the scholarship
and became a part WKC. A lot of credits to be given to the camps. Soft skill was a
cliche during the initial days, but soon I became accustomed to it. Lessons on language
skills, individual effectiveness, group activities and individual presentations were the
essence of the camps. A little flavor being added through campfires, barbeque night,
candlelight dinner, etc. Overall it was an extensive package with all that one could ask
for. There is a sense of belonging to the World Konkani Center. Time literally flies.
I bemoan the fact that I’m done with all the KSHAMATA camps. The support that
VKSSF and its alumni are offering us is phenomenal. An extremely small, negligible
percentage of the population has received the training that I and my fellow Konkani
youths have received. I feel very lucky to be a part of Konkani community and receive
such a wonderful opportunity. I’m very happy to be shaped into a diamond from a mere
amoebic stone that I was. It's been a long journey since then, I believe it's just the
beginning of an even better and bigger enthralling experience ahead of me. I can clearly
remember the lines “Konkani amchi avi korea matik vandan…amchi bhasti konkani”.
The sweet and fun-filled memories are deeply instilled in my subconscious memory. The
spirit of community hood is very relevant in today’s nuclear world. With families getting
fragmented and shrinking human bondings, in order to feel alive and human-like, not
robotic. The values that our culture propagates and practices have to lead to the
success of many in the community. A long list of eminent personalities who have
achieved humongous success with knowledge and compassion have inspired me
throughout the journey. I dream of being one of them and showing them my gratitude
and respect for their efforts in empowering my generation. I believe in philanthropy and
compassionate capitalism. The philosophy of helping ourselves and giving it to others
requires a certain degree of evolutionary mind. My community is one such where giving
is a culture. I feel proud and privileged to be born in this community and one day I shall
make my community proud of what it has given me. Konkani shall not be limited to my
biodata, it shall remain in my heart and mind.
