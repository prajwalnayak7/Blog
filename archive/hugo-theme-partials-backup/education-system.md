The world needs learning based systems not teaching based, collaboration based not authority based, 
creativity based and not process based.

Creativity cannot sprout without experimentation. Trail and Error is the only known algorithm for innovation, but not all are willing to pay the price of failures which are essential for success. Encouraging new ideas, questions old ways and trying better 
approaches. Children should not expected to act like databases, inject information while being enclosed in four walls; query it
during the tests and flush DB once done. What makes a difference is the ability to think different, solve problems and have an profound understanding of the reality of the creation. Classrooms could be a means for interaction and discussions not a means to dissiminate information, which can be done far more efficiently via asynchronous modes via the digital platforms.

The cost of education can be reduced close to nil if only we could move to a digital university. The best professors could record the lectures once and make it available to all, a democratic format where anyone can learn anything and get the certfications as per one's convenienve if so desired by taking tests. Instead of a one size fits all arrangement, freedom based learning and self-motiviated learning are far more effective and less stressful for the students.
