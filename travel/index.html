  <div class="post-content"><p>Breathtaking! A stare at the water falling from 100s of feet above the ground, gives an illusion of heaven.
The milk-ish water molecules racing to hit the ground is a mesmerizing view.
Sitting on the rocks and just staring at them for hours brings
tranquility. It makes one realize what true beauty is, how insignificant one
is at the face of a larger creation.</p>
<p>By observing the crowd, It seemed like everybody is into modeling. People
are too fond of themselves and their photography skills for their next status update on
Whatsapp or a post on Instagram. Though I visited the place during the
COVID-19 pandemic, none seem to care except the notice boards. Maybe people
worry more about preventing mosquito bites than the social transmutation of
the virus.</p>
<p>The steps to reach the foot of the falls is an excellent fitness test for
anyone. If one can manage this without much difficulty, congratulations!</p>
<p>A ton of monkeys around, and some of their friends who&rsquo;ve been promoted into
human beings but still behave like the former. Extra cautious with the food
items especially bananas, the invisible eyes jumping from one branch to the other all around could be surprising.
Animals are cute, some innocent, but not when they eat all that you‚Äôve
brought from a faraway place and are extremely hungry.</p>
<p>Magnificent site of water molecules achieving freedom via gravitational
energy. Truly, freedom transforms (from liquid to vapor state in this case).
The ones that dare, the ones that fall the steepest have the gloriest ends.
Fail big, fall high.</p>
<p>Travelling is an expression of freedom, of joy, and of experiencing the
unseen.</p>
